### üéØ Who Is This Tool For?

This tool is designed for users who find Git's interactive mode insufficient but do not need advanced features.
If you require more powerful features, we recommend using tools like [tig](https://github.com/jonas/tig). Alternatively, you can utilize Git's standard `-i` option for entering interactive mode.
`git-select-list` is a lightweight solution for those looking for a balance between simplicity and usability.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Interactive UI**: Navigate with arrow keys, select with `a` or `s`, and toggle all with `u`.
- **Multiple Actions**: Supports `git add`, `git stash`, `git stash apply`, and `git stash drop`.
- **Lightweight Setup**: No external dependencies, with an included setup script.
